Image Search Abstraction Layer
Created by J. Munford
Node JS / Express / HTML / SQL (Sequelize)

This is an abstraction layer for the Bing API. The search values are stored into a database for ease of organization.

Part of a series of small API tools created as a way to teach myself API basics.

This project was created as part of a FreeCodeCamp program and to meet the following deliverables:

* I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
* I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
* I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.

TO-DO: Write documentation within the code.
